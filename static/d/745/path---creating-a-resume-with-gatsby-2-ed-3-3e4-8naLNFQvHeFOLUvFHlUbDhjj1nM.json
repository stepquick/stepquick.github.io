I started my research with gatsby docs however I ended up using a list of google searches for similar questions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50242492/gatsby-multiple-content-types\">StackOverflow - Gatsby: Multiple Content Types</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://desktopofsamuel.com/building-gatsby-with-multiple-post-type\">Samuel W - Building Gatsby With Multiple Post Type</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I chose to use the <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog#v2\">gatsby default starter blog</a> since it’s super simple and gives a good idea of how to use the graphql. Using the layout of the content folder at the base of the theme, I chose to create a folder called jobs and structure it similarly to the default blog folder.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">content\n——blogs\n    —— Blog Post #1\n\t\t——index.md\n——jobs\n\t——Job #1\n\t\t——index.md\t</code></pre></div>\n<p>Each job will be somewhat structured like the blog entries:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">title: &quot;Application Analyst/Developer, Senior&quot;\nstartdate: 2017-01-01\nenddate: 2018-04-30\nlocation: &quot;Oxford, GA&quot;\ncompany: &quot;Emory University&quot;</code></pre></div>\n<p>I will be using the dates for ordering the content, as well as using enddate value to determine what is my current job. I chose to go simpler and did not include a category filter on the each markdown file. I will be using graphql to filter by path, which works for my example.</p>\n<p>For this to work, I did the same as Samuel W and added to my <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby-config.js</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">{\n\tresolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,\n\toptions: {\n\t\tpath: `${__dirname}/content/jobs`,\n\t\tname: `jobs`,\n\t},\n},</code></pre></div>\n<p>Using this allows graphql to find my list of jobs. However, using it just this way will have the posts and jobs show up all together on the index page, which I don’t want. I don’t need to add anything to the <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby-node.js</code>. These jobs will only be listed on my resume, and don’t need their own additional pages. </p>\n<p>[picture here maybe of all the content blurring together?]</p>\n<p>I needed to add to my <code class=\"language-text\">src/pages/index.js</code> to filter by absolute path “/blog”:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">export const pageQuery = graphql`\n  query {\n    site {\n      siteMetadata {\n        title\n      }\n    }\n    allMarkdownRemark(\n      sort: { fields: [frontmatter___date], order: DESC },\n      filter: { fileAbsolutePath: { regex: &quot;/blog/&quot;} } ) {\n      edges {\n        node {\n          excerpt\n          fields {\n            slug\n          }\n          frontmatter {\n            date(formatString: &quot;MMMM DD, YYYY&quot;)\n            title\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }</code></pre></div>\n<p>This way the index page will only show content under blog, and not everything. Next will be to add a new page called <code class=\"language-text\">resume.js</code> to the pages folder. <a href=\"https://github.com/stepquick/stepquick.github.io/blob/source/src/pages/resume.js\">Github link to resume.js</a></p>\n<p>It’s similar to how index.js works, however I am filtering for “/jobs/” path instead. I also don’t need to worry about linking to the jobs, I will only be printing them out to the generated page. You can see the live page here: <a href=\"https://stepquick.net/resume\"> resume</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Creating an online resume using GatsbyJS 2.x","date":"March 13, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/creating-a-resume-with-gatsby-2/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/removing-disqus/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Removing Disqus"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/web-developer-senior/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Web Developer, Senior"}}}}
