What happened was the Mac I’m using didn’t notice that I had ruby and rvm installed in my home folder, so it started using the version of ruby installed in Homebrew. That meant something had altered my .bash_profile so I decided to check it out.</p>\n<p>I checked my bash_profile, which originally that’s where the link for rvm was installed.</p>\n<p>The three locations are either ~.bashrc, ~.bash_profile, or ~.profile, either of these three would need to be checked.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">[[ -s &quot;$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm&quot; ]] &amp;&amp; source &quot;$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm&quot;</code></pre></div>\n<p>This appeared to solve my issue and I was able to get back to using ruby.</p>\n<p>Update: I was having another issue where rvm kept using the system installed ruby version. I set the new version 2.1.1 to be default, which seems to have resolved my issue. It was pretty annoying.</p>\n<p>I tried setting it again using this command:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">rvm get stable --auto-dotfiles</code></pre></div>\n<p>It temporarily works, closing the terminal appears to reset it back to the original issue. So I tried setting a default with RVM using:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">rvm use 2.1.1 default</code></pre></div>\n<p>This solved my issue, and instead of using the local copy, it uses the .rvm version. However here is what’s shown if I echo <code class=\"language-text\">$PATH</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">/Users/QuickMirror/Dropbox/dotfiles:/Users/QuickMirror/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.1/bin:/Users/QuickMirror/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.1@global/bin:/Users/QuickMirror/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.1/bin:/Users/QuickMirror/bin:$HOME/Dropbox/dotfiles:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Users/QuickMirror/.rvm/bin</code></pre></div>\n<p>As you can see dotfiles still shows up in from which actually made me realize, I was using <code class=\"language-text\">.path</code> as an older alternative to try and get dotfiles to work, so I ended up removing that piece which solved my <code class=\"language-text\">$PATH</code> issue. Echoing <code class=\"language-text\">$PATH</code> now shows the proper order:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">/Users/QuickMirror/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.1/bin:/Users/QuickMirror/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.1@global/bin:/Users/QuickMirror/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.1/bin:/Users/QuickMirror/bin:$HOME/Dropbox/dotfiles:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Users/QuickMirror/.rvm/bin</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"title":"RVM missing on Mac","date":"February 26, 2014"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/rvm-troubles-on-mac/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/how-to-remove-mysql-installation-on-mac/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to remove MySQL installation on Mac"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/gist-test/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"gist test"}}}}
