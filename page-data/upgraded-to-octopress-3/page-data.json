It also seems to include default jekyll commands, as well as a default jekyll theme. Deploy also works amazing, it’s exactly what I was wanting. I hated having issues with deploying from multiple computers.</p>\n<p>I also need to do some house cleaning for this site. A few things that stick out are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Convert to using a more handmade theme/something nicer. Jekyll default theme is fairly nice, but I have to add more stuff that I enjoyed from the older octopress theme.</li>\n<li>Add more content, I’ve got a bunch of things I’d like to remember from working recently, and this is as good a place as any to store these things.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Upgraded to Octopress 3","date":"September 16, 2015","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/installing-homestead-on-ubuntu/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Installing Homestead on Ubuntu"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/how-to-disable-chrome-web-security-for-development/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to disable Chrome Web Security for development"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ffb46e08-335f-51c9-a31b-b123e2b0bd2a","previousPostId":"db36c069-de61-59ca-bae1-88e09964d75b","nextPostId":"6325b5de-26c7-5bb0-8db1-e4c90c2f1cac"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1804815106","3000541721"],"slicesMap":{}}
