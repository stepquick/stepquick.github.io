I had some initially, and I ended up having to destroy my repository and start over again.</p>\n<p>Instructions can be found <a href=\"http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/\">here</a></p>\n<h3>Side effects:</h3>\n<p>It appears my ability to use rake preview is broken, but that might really be related to my VM not appearing to forward the 4000 port, which I can’t tell if that’s an issue with the machine or not. I may just replace the VM.</p>\n<p>I also noticed that this process doesn’t really seem to enjoy posting from more than one computer. I found out the hard way and I ended up having to blast the repository completely and start from scratch. I found that once you run <code class=\"language-text\">rake setup_github_pages</code> and tried to generate and deploy the site it would say something along the lines of being out of sync.</p>\n<h3>Solution:</h3>\n<p>After running <code class=\"language-text\">rake setup_github_pages</code>, don’t run generate or deploy, but instead go into the new <code class=\"language-text\">_deploy</code> folder and run <code class=\"language-text\">git pull origin master</code>. It should merge your current master branch into the folder. There will be an index merge conflict, which is easy to delete the old one. Doing this should allow you to run <code class=\"language-text\">rake deploy</code> successfully to commit the blog.</p>\n<p>If you don’t plan on maintaining this blog with more than one computer, then this probably isn’t the biggest problem for you.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Migration from Dreamhost to Namecheap and Github","date":"January 28, 2015"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/migration-from-dreamhost-to-namecheap-and-github/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/use-varnish-with-nginx-and-ubuntu/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Use Varnish with Nginx and Ubuntu"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/switch-between-php-and-hhvm/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Switch between PHP and HHVM in Terminal"}}}}}
