Since the API is another sub domain, Chrome complains that it is a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS\">CORS</a> violation, automatically disallowing the request. This causes the application to hang forever because the route is dependent on calling this api first. What I decided to do was look up how to circumvent CORS in Google Chrome to test that it works correctly. I only need to do this locally, since I already authorized the live production version to work correctly.</p>\n<p>The command I found was from a <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/q/3102819/1612852\">Stack Overflow</a> request.</p>\n<p>On Mac: <code class=\"language-text\">open -a Google\\ Chrome --args --disable-web-security --user-data-dir</code>.</p>\n<p>On Linux: <code class=\"language-text\">google-chrome --args --disable-web-security --user-data-dir</code></p>\n<p>On Windows: <code class=\"language-text\">chrome.exe --args --disable-web-security --user-data-dir</code></p>\n<p>The later versions of Chrome say <code class=\"language-text\">--disable-web-security</code> has been depreciated, but it still works. The flag <code class=\"language-text\">--use-data-dir</code> appears to be required for CORS to be disabled.</p>\n<h3>Downside</h3>\n<p>Currently working on learning more about how to disable in Firefox, Safari, and ie11/edge. I may just commit to using Chrome locally, and checking the production version from the rest of the browsers.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to disable Chrome Web Security for development","date":"July 26, 2016","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/upgraded-to-octopress-3/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Upgraded to Octopress 3"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/disable-gpg-for-deployment/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Disable GPG for Octopress Deploy"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"6325b5de-26c7-5bb0-8db1-e4c90c2f1cac","previousPostId":"ffb46e08-335f-51c9-a31b-b123e2b0bd2a","nextPostId":"170ccfcb-6b3a-5b2a-90d8-c349d232e7d1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1804815106","3000541721"],"slicesMap":{}}
