The simple change I found from a <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19822319/jekyll-regeneration-doesnt-work-inside-vagrant\">stackoverflow</a> post is instead of calling just jeykll build —watch, use jekyll build —watch —force_polling.</p>\n<p>I replace the this line in the rakefile:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">jekyllPid = Process.spawn({\"OCTOPRESS_ENV\"=>\"preview\"}, \"jekyll build --watch\")</code></pre></div>\n<p>with:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">jekyllPid = Process.spawn({\"OCTOPRESS_ENV\"=>\"preview\"}, \"jekyll build --watch --force_polling\")</code></pre></div>\n<p>Both generate rake watch and rake preview use this line, so make sure to replace both. This seems to have solved my issue with rake preview/watch. The question also has an answer suggesting that vagrant uses a special driver for the file syncing between guest and host machines, making the regeneration not work properly, so that’s something to keep in mind.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Force regeneration on jekyll watch","date":"August 15, 2014","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/adding-upstream/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Fetching Upstream changes"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/use-gulp-notify-with-terminal-notifier/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Notifications Using Gulp-Notify on Vagrant with Terminal-Notifier"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"4a376974-e6b4-5058-a5b4-8a65bf493b1b","previousPostId":"519bbd72-1d32-547c-9c4f-66122b959d32","nextPostId":"093020e0-5f01-5ff9-8297-09a00914f674"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1804815106","3000541721"],"slicesMap":{}}
