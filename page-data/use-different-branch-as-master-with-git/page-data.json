Currently <a href=\"http://degreesearch.arizona.edu\">Degree Search</a> is split into three branches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Master: Current live version</li>\n<li>3.0: Different version, stopped work once laravel 5 was released</li>\n<li>5.0: Most recent version implemented in laravel 5.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At this point I no longer wanted the current version to be what I work on anymore, so I decided to change branches. However there doesn’t appear to be very straightforward, especially since the 5.0 branch doesn’t have a shared history from master, I pushed it remotely from my local dev environment.</p>\n<p>###Note: please make a backup branch of master before doing this, it’s easier this way</p>\n<p>Following this <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/2763118/1612852\">Stack Overflow</a> I was able to find something that not only merged the master history, but also replaced the files with my current dev branch. While on the master branch I ran these commands:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">git checkout yourbranchname\r\ngit merge --strategy=ours master\r\ngit checkout master\r\ngit merge yourbranchname</code></pre></div>\n<p>The writer of the answer also suggests more detailed messaging in the commit, so you could instead do this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">git checkout yourbranchname\r\ngit merge --strategy=ours --no-commit master\r\ngit commit # add information to the template merge message\r\ngit checkout master\r\ngit merge yourbranchname</code></pre></div>\n<p>This solved my issues of having to deal with the master branch, considering it’s being migrated to a newer version. All that was left after this was to switch to the backup older branch for the live site and test the new master branch. Other than a few things that got wiped away in the branch switch, everything merged correctly.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Use different branch as master with Git","date":"March 24, 2015","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/switch-between-php-and-hhvm/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Switch between PHP and HHVM in Terminal"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/installing-homestead-on-ubuntu/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Installing Homestead on Ubuntu"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"fe7397d6-ddae-57c8-88c5-4aa6049bc8e8","previousPostId":"00e856f0-76c4-55fc-9969-d368fbb9d789","nextPostId":"529ba22a-d5e0-519e-80eb-daab188b9066"}},
