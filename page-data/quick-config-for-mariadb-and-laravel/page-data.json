I decided to try out <a href=\"http://laravel.com/docs/valet\">Laravel Valet</a>, which doesn’t need a VM for setup, just <a href=\"http://brew.sh/\">brew</a>. This however doesn’t include a db by default. I decided to use <a href=\"https://mariadb.com/\">MariaDB</a> due to its ease of use.</p>\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n<p>Since I have brew installed it’s super easy to configure:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">brew install mariadb\r\nunset TMPDIR\r\nbrew services start mariadb\r\nmysql_install_db</code></pre></div>\n<p>Caveats:</p>\n<p>I initially had trouble getting this to work properly, and determined it might’ve been related to not starting the service before attempting to install a db, so make sure you start the service before attempting to connect to the mariadb server.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">mysql -uroot</code> should work out without a password, if you want to secure this just run <code class=\"language-text\">mysql_secure_installation</code>, however in my case I don’t really need a password setup since I’m only doing work on my local machine.</p>\n<h2>Create User/Database</h2>\n<p>After I had it setup and logged in, I ran a few commands to create a database and user to access it. Since laravel includes a default config for a homestead db and user, I decided to just stick with those.</p>\n<p>First login to the server <code class=\"language-text\">mysql -uroot</code>, then run these commands:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">  create database homestead;\r\n  create user 'homestead'@'localhost' identified by 'secret';\r\n  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON homestead.* to 'homestead'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;</code></pre></div>\n<p>This gives the proper permissions I need to run laravel locally.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Configuration for using MariaDB with Laravel and El Capitan","date":"August 29, 2016","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/disable-gpg-for-deployment/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Disable GPG for Octopress Deploy"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/removing-disqus/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Removing Disqus"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a9d3eb8e-86f3-57b1-b03b-818c8912c186","previousPostId":"cffe0852-e08d-5a3c-a5ec-7a304036b446","nextPostId":"ae652cab-17c2-5e62-bd71-15931f39ecdb"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1804815106","3000541721"],"slicesMap":{}}
