Switching out the language that’s called when using PHP on the terminal is as simple as using this command:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">sudo /usr/bin/update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/php php /usr/bin/hhvm 60</code></pre></div>\n<p>This will do it without any input, and you should be able to check by running. <code class=\"language-text\">php -v</code>. If you get hhvm version stuff, you should be good.</p>\n<p>My next important question was how to switch back to using PHP. Again, simple:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">sudo /usr/bin/update-alternatives --config php</code></pre></div>\n<p>It will then ask you to select from a list of options. My options were:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">There are 2 choices for the alternative php (providing /usr/bin/php).\n\n  Selection    Path            Priority   Status\n------------------------------------------------------------\n  0            /usr/bin/hhvm    60        auto mode\n  1            /usr/bin/hhvm    60        manual mode\n* 2            /usr/bin/php5    50        manual mode\n\nPress enter to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number:</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Switch between PHP and HHVM in Terminal","date":"February 20, 2015","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/migration-from-dreamhost-to-namecheap-and-github/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Migration from Dreamhost to Namecheap and Github"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/use-different-branch-as-master-with-git/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Use different branch as master with Git"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"10d35484-4e29-5eba-bf47-1bc2788c4b57","previousPostId":"d5b24b07-94ee-5c31-8246-789f53698f75","nextPostId":"4653f2cf-80f7-5290-8931-a12a02f62936"}},
