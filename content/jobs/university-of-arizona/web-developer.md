Primary developer on the degree search project in joint collaboration between Student Affairs, Academic Affairs, and UITS. Originally a drupal based project, I migrated to a Custom PHP based application which sped up data corrections on the site. This new site used a SOAP based XML and JSON feed to keep data on the site up to date with UofA undergrad programs.
