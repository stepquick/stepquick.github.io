* Created drag and drop file uploading panel which is used for uploading files associated to cases in Asset Forfeiture department.
* Migrated 60+ dbs from 2008 sql server to new 2012/2017 sql server using backup/restore in ssms, and the database migration assistant.
* Migrated 20+ web applications from windows server 2008 to windows server 2016 to improve responsiveness and security, as well as creating individual ad users for running each of the applications.
* Planned and developed migration plan for Public Integrity coldfusion application to asp.net core project, and a restful api.
* Created modal system for VIMS(Victims Information Management System) for DA's Victims Services using js and asp.net partial views, removing the need to reload pages. Secured API calls using CORS, Roles, and managing Auth0 integration for OIDC.
* Currently develop/maintain the Harris County DA website https://www.harriscountyda.com, a lemp stack using PHP/Drupal 8, Nginx, and Ubuntu.
* I maintain and upgrade an existing Azure Devops (formerly TFS) installation, as well as created continuous deployment build/release for existing and new projects. Using package management allowed me to create simpler deployment setups for projects that relied on shared projects. Making these projects nuget packages made it easier to build/deploy several projects using Azure Devops.
