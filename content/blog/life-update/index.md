Hey there, it's been a while since I posted something. For starters I haven't really been focusing on dev outside of my fulltime job. In order to help with restlessness I have decided to start using my dev-related blog as a personal blog too. 

I thought it might be fun (for me) to include stuff here so I have a place to look back on it as a reminder of past actions. Not sure when I'll start doing that, but maybe in the near future.

I 've also updated my [resume](/resume) so it's grouped by company now, making it easier to read for me. I also fixed my date utility to remove weird spacing, and tried to clean up date generation. Still seems off by a bit on generating dates. Please check out the source code [here](https://github.com/stepquick/stepquick.github.io/blob/source/src/pages/resume.js).
