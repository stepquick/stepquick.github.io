I finally got around to upgrading to [Octopress 3](http://www.github.com/octopress/octopress.git) and honestly it's a noticeable difference.

For starters, it's very clean, and doesn't include nearly as much boilerplate as the older version does. It also seems to include default jekyll commands, as well as a default jekyll theme. Deploy also works amazing, it's exactly what I was wanting. I hated having issues with deploying from multiple computers.

I also need to do some house cleaning for this site. A few things that stick out are:

* Convert to using a more handmade theme/something nicer. Jekyll default theme is fairly nice, but I have to add more stuff that I enjoyed from the older octopress theme.
* Add more content, I've got a bunch of things I'd like to remember from working recently, and this is as good a place as any to store these things.
